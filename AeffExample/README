These are the basic steps to do an Aeff calculation using MEGAlib. 

Starting with our geometry file:

I've broken this into a series of steps and example files

First visit cosmia_example.txt. This will create a simulation file needed for the reconstruction

Next both sivan and revan are event reconstruction programs. The simple instructions are found in 
sivan_example.txt and revan_example.txt

It seems like revan is prefered in the MEGAlib documentation. We can dig more into the details. I've used both and they appear to produce similar results. 

I'll use the output of revan for the rest of the example. 

Next is mimrec (mimrec_example.txt) This takes the output .tra file from revan and does image reconstruction. 

Here we'll get the basic telescope performance parameters: 

Energy Resolution

The Angular resoultion (ARM) of a point source

The Effective Area (finally :))
