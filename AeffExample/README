These are the basic steps to do an Aeff calculation using MEGAlib. 

We're using MEGALib v. 3.00.00 (http://megalibtoolkit.com)
Root Version: 6.18.04
Geant4 Version: v10.02.p03

Starting with our geometry file:

I've broken this into a series of steps and example files

First visit cosmia_example.txt. This will create a simulation file needed for the reconstruction

Next both sivan and revan are event reconstruction programs. We'll be using revan for our work. See instructions in revan_example.txt 

Next is mimrec (mimrec_example.txt) This takes the output .tra file from revan and does image reconstruction. 

Here we'll get the basic telescope performance parameters: 

Energy Resolution

The Angular resoultion (ARM) of a point source

The Effective Area (finally :))
