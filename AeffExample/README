These are the basic steps to do an Aeff calculation using MEGAlib. 

We're using MEGALib v. 3.00.00 (http://megalibtoolkit.com)
Root Version: 6.18.04
Geant4 Version: v10.02.p03

Starting with our geometry file:

I've broken this into a series of steps and example files

First visit cosmia_example.txt. This will create a simulation file needed for the reconstruction

Next both sivan and revan are event reconstruction programs. Sivan is for perfect event reconstruction and doesnâ€™t take into account and detector effects/thresholds/resolutions. It is typically only used for debugging and better understanding of the instrument response. Revan is the standard reconstruction tool and should almost always be used.

We'll be using revan for our work. See instructions in revan_example.txt 

Next is mimrec (mimrec_example.txt) This takes the output .tra file from revan and does image reconstruction. 

Here we'll get the basic telescope performance parameters: 

Energy Resolution

The Angular resoultion (ARM) of a point source

The Effective Area (finally :))
