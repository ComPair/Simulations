Instructions for calculating Aeff for CompairBase.geo.setup. 
These numbers are for the TowerModel as of 7/15/2016

I am using an example source file, based on the example source file that is provided in MEGAlib

Information about UseCase1.source:
It uses the Livermore physics lists which are recommended for lower energy EM processes (Standard is better for high energy events)
It requires 20k triggereed events before stopping. (There are various ways to stop the process, such as number of events or time)
It is a restricted point source starting at an x,y,z position (in cm) from the detector. The position has to be outside the surrounding sphere of the detector. There are a lot of options for the sources. 
It is a monoenergetic pencil beam at 1000 keV of gamma-rays (particle type 1)
There are also various types of sources (gaussian, black body, etc)
The flux is measured in particles/cm2/s for far field, or intensity in particles/sec for all other sources

Now you're ready to use cosima, the COsmic SImulator for MegAlib based on Geant4

To execute
>>cosmia UseCase1.source

This runs events until the stop criteria. 
As this runs, the output (for me) looked like this:

Once it hit 20k triggers, this was the output summary:

Then outputs a UseCase1.inc1.id1.sim file
This file is needed for the subsequent steps.  

Next step is to use sivan or revan to analyze the data....
