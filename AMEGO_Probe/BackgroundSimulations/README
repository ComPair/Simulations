The Background Simulations for AMEGO have been performed in MEGAlib and are detailed on the confluence page: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/COMPair/Background+Simulations+in+MEGAlib. Here we have included all of the files that were used and created in that process. The raw .sim files from the simulation are not included, since they are prohibitively large, but the final .tra files after event reconstruction are included in ComPair/Simulation-Data-Files/AMEGO_Probe/BackgroundSimulations. 

The version of the *Geometry* files used in these simulations is located here (commit: 36983e5):

The *IsotopeFiles* directory contains the *Isotope.dat files that are created in the first step of the activation simulations (for HadronicComponentsPrompt.source, TrappedHadronicComponentsPrompt.source, and TrappedLeptonicComponentsPrompt.source) 

The *SourceFiles* contains the background source files. These were obtained from MEGAlib's BackgroundGenerator assuming an altitude of 575 km, a Inclination angle of 6 deg, and an average Geomagentic Cutoff of 11.9. If these orbital parameters do not change, you can use these .source files. Just be sure to change the path of the Geometry in Common.partial.source. There are 6 .source and .dat files that were produced through the activation simulations performed in June 2019. These have been dated as such and are kept here for future reference.

The *TraFiles_R1* and *TraFiles_R5* include the final results from the Background Simulations from June 2019. The names of these directories refer to the difference revan configuration files that were used during the reconstruction (which are included here). The *TraFiles_R1* uses the configuration revan_R1_clustering.cfg and *TraFiles_R5* uses revan_R5_firstinteractionD1_MIPS_clustering.cfg. The main difference is that R5 requires the first interaction to be in the tracker and therefore is more suited for higher energy pair events. R1 allows for events which are only contained in the CZT and thus has a higher effective area in the Compton regime. In each of these directories, there is a TotalBackground.R*.tra.gz which points to the .tra files in ComPair/Simulation-Data-Files/AMEGO_Probe/BackgroundSimulations. Thre is also a spectrum that shows each background component.

BackgroundViewer.C is a MEGAlib script which allows you to view the intital .source and .dat files that are being used in the simulations. The output of BackgroundViewer.C for the June 2019 source files contained here are shown in Background_Altitude575km_Inclination6_GeomagneticCutoff11.9.pdf.
