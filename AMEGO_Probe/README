In this repository, we have all of the simulations that were run for the AMEGO Probe White Paper. This includes the
Background Simulations (the .tra files are kept under the Simulation-Data-Files repo), the Mono-energetic Point source
simulations for instrument performance (which are obtained with the scripts in the python repo), and the science simulations.
