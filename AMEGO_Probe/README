In this repository, we have all of the simulations that were run for the AMEGO Probe White Paper 
(using this version of the AMEGO geometry located her: ComPair/Geometry/AMEGO_Probe commit: 206732d). 

This includes 
1) Background Simulations (the .tra files are kept under the Simulation-Data-Files repo),
2) the mono-energetic point source simulations for instrument performance (which are obtained with the scripts in the python repo; the .tra files are kept under
the Simulation-Data-Files repo),
3) the science simulations performed for the AMEGO Mission White Paper in June 2019
